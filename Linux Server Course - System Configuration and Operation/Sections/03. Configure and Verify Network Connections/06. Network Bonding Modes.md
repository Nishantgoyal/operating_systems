# Network Bonding Modes

- A way to utilize more than one network interfaces on the computer
- There are two kinds of network bonds
  - require switch support
  - generic
- A lot of switches, especially layer 3 (smart switches)
  - supports link aggregation
  - also known as LICP, ether channel
  - have built-in code that allows the interfaces to work together

| MODE | Description   | Need Switch Support?           |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0    | balance-rr    | yes (if connected to a switch) |
| 1    | active backup | No                             |
| 2    | balance-Xor   | Yes                            |
| 3    | broadcast     | Yes                            |
| 4    | 802.3ad       | Yes                            |
| 5    | balance-tlb   | No                             |
| 6    | balance-alb   | No                             |

- _balance-rr_
  - Mode-0
  - transmit packet1 through interface1
  - then packet2 through interface2
  - and so on...
  - if plugged into the switch
    - it does require a switch that supports link aggregation
  - when systems are directly connected through cross-over cables without a switch
    - they use balance-rr
    - do not require switch support in this case
- _active-backup_
  - Mode-1
  - easy to understand
  - for all the interfaces on the system, only one is active
  - If the active interface fails, another one becomes active
  - does not speed up the transfer
- _balance-Xor_
  - Mode-2
  - Does require special switch support
  - It does a _hash_ based on the interface's mac address and the client's mac address
    - based on the _hash_ chooses which interface to use
    - spread out, which clients use which interface to connect to
  - Not used very often cause of a better link aggregation industry standard protocol - 802.3ad
- _broadcast_
  - Mode-3
  - used in very specific cases
  - use all of the interfaces, and spews data on all of them simaltaneously
  - Not used very often
  - require switch support
- _802.3ad_
  - Mode-4
  - Link Aggregation Protocol
  - Industry Standard
- _balance-tlb_
  - Mode-5
  - Does not require specialised switch support
  - transmit load balance
  - transmits from the interface which is currently least busy
  - all the transmit is going to be balanced out
  - incoming is always going to one of the bound interfaces
  - constantly changes the MAC address
  - switch thinks that the system has moved
- _balance-alb_
  - Mode-6
  - Does not require specialised switch support
  - all load balance
  - transmits and receive on the least busy interface
  - same concept
