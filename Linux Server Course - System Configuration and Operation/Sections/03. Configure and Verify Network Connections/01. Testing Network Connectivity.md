# Testing Network Connectivity

## TroubleShooting

- Check if network is reachable using command line
  - `ping www.google.com`
  - This can fail, cause of multiple reasons
    - DNS is not working
    - Network is not reachable
- To eliminate network issue
  - `ping 8.8.8.8`
  - If it fails, it means Network is not reachable
- To check network address
  - `ifconfig`
  - `ip addr`
    - provides the IP addresses for the local computer
    - `lo` device -- localhost
    - `ethX` - ethernet port
- To check network stack
  - `ping <ethX IP>`
  - `ping <Gateway Addr for Network>`
  - If it works, the Network Stack is fine
  - It also implies that the Network is down
- To check IP Routing Information
  - `ip route`
    - check if `self network CIDR` is accessible via ethernet
    - check if default route set is there
      - if not there, implies network traffic cannot escape to other networks
      - probably DHCP Server did not provide all the information
      - restart the network stack
      - should provide the complete routing information
