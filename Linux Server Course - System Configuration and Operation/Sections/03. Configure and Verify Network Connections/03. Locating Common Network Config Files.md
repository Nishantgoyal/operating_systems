# Locating Common Network Config Files

- In Linux everything is configured with text files
- The configurations might differ with each distribution
  - but there are some common configurations
- These common configurations are consistent and standard linux files
- `/etc/hosts` file
  - No extension at end of this file
  - This file acts as the first resort DNS lookup
  - We can add DNS entries here to override DNS resolutions
- `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file
  - configures a bunch of things on the system
    - like group/password files
  - also configures, the priority of DNS lookups
    - by default, the first lookup is _file_ and points to _/etc/hosts_ file
    - then it does local lookups, and so on
    - the order of DNS lookups can be modified with this file
- `/etc/resolv.conf` file
  - It tells the system what nameserver to use
  - DO NOT EDIT this file, handled by _systemd-resolved_ service
