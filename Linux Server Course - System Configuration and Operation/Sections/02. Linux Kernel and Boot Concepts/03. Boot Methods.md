# Boot Methods

- Linux supports booting using different methods or sources
- The boot process can be
  - Hardware based
    - It refers to the BIOS or UEFI
      - The part that executes before Operating System is loaded
    - All things (even Software Based) have to start in the hardware
  - Software based
    - These come into play, once it loads into the linux operating system
- There are also multiple ways that linux system can boot over
  - PXE
    - boots up completely over the network
  - iPXE
    - advanced version of PXE
    - uses HTTP instead of TFTP
      - faster and more reliable
  - USB
  - CD
    - same as USB
  - HardDrive
    - same as USB
  - ISO
    - just like `.iso` files
    - requires a grub2 entry
    - boot directly from ISO
    - without it being burned to disk or USB drive

## PXE

- It is a Hardware Based Boot Method
- It means _Pre-boot Execution Environment_
- In this method, the hardware do not need a hard drive
  - It queries the network - DHCP server
  - DHCP server responds with
    - IP address
    - a boot file
    - a TFTP location
      - A TFTP server is just a location where files can be stored on the network
  - downloads the boot image
    - from the TFTP server
  - The boot fike is the linux kernel
  - Puts the kernel into memory
  - boots itself from there

## USB

- Hardware Based Boot Method
- The linux boot image is on the USB
- Hardware knows it can boot from USB

## ISO

- It is Software Based Boot Method
- uses GRUB2
  - looks into the ISO
  - use the ISO image as the operating system
  - just like if it was burnt to a CD
  - It is where one selects the Kernel
  - can have MemTest
