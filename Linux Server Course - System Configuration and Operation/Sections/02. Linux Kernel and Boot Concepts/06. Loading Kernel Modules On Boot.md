# Loading Kernel Modules On Boot

- The Linux Kernel is modular
- The kernel dynamically loads the required modules
  - as and when required
  - for e.g., a driver is required for a Sound Card
- It does not load all the drivers it could possibly ever need on boot

## Loading a Module

- The Kernel can be manually configured to automatically load modules
  - To manually add a module, which will be automatically loaded on boot-time
  - Add the name of the module to the `/etc/modules` file
  - It will also load all the dependencies of the module
- While loading the module, there is a dependency checking
  - Dependency Checking figures out what other modules, a particular module depend on
  - To disallow a module from ever loading, it can be blacklisted
- To blacklist a module
  - Add the name of the module in the `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf` file
  - Important when a module is misbehaving
  - The kernel will not automatically load the module on boot, and pick an alternate
  - The kernel will pick an alternate module if required for a particular device
