# Boot Modules and Files

- The boot process
  - gets the kernel running
  - allows the kernel
    - access to the modules, stored on the hard drive

## Boot Process

1. **_The Computer starts with either BIOS or UEFI_**
   - It is on the hardware in the computer
   - It looks for something that GRUB/GRUB2 will provide
2. **_Then the GRUB/GRUB2 uses the boot code contained in it_**
   - The boot code points us to the kernel
3. **_Then the linux kernel is loaded_**
   - the kernel is a single file, called
     - _vmlinux_ (or _vmlinuz_ for the compressed one)
   - It does not contain any modules
4. **_The kernel boots up_**
   - It mounts the _initramfs_ file system
   - have access to all the modules required
   - Modules are loaded into the kernel
   - The issue is
     - _The modules could be on a file system, which the kernel do not know how to mount_
       - e.g., NFS or a new SSD
     - This is where the _initrd_ comes in
5. **_The `initrd` is loaded_**
   - It means the _init ram disk_
   - It provides just enough information
     - for the linux kernel
     - to be able to access (and mount) the file system
     - containing the modules
   - The Kernel can then get to the modules
   - It is mounted alongside the kernel
   - It is not used after the system is booted up

## Boot Files

- These files are located at `/boot` folder path
- `initrd.img-x.xx.x-xx-generic`
  - This is the init ram disk file
- `vmlinuz-x.xx.x-xx-generic`
  - The actual kernel file
- `System.map-x.xx.x-xx-generic`
  - tells the kernel
  - where on the file system
  - all the modules live inside
    - `/lib/modules/x.xx.x-xx-generic` folder
- `config-x.xx.x-xx-generic`
  - The configuration file
  - when the kernel was actually compiled
  - can be used to see the options that were put in the compilation process
