# BIOS and UEFI

- These are interfaces between
  - The Hardware, and
  - The Operating System
- A Computer will have either BIOS or UEFI

## BIOS

- Older Program
- Basic Input Output System
- The very first sector on the HardDrive is the _boot sector_
- The _MBR_ will live in the boot sector
- The MBR tells
  - where the partitions are
  - points to where to boot
- Limitations
  - Only four partitions are allowed
    - hacks required to extend
  - size of the drive which can be referenced via the MBR

## UEFI

- Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
- Replacement technology for BIOS
- Has an entire partition on the system
  - contains the entire boot code for the operating system
- Uses a different kind of partition scheme
  - allows tons and tons of partitions
  - can address a much larger hard drive
- supports secure boot
- It is the operating system that handles all the intricacies, if it is booted with UEFI
