# Using Head, Tail, More and Less

## Head

- shows first few lines of a text file
- default: _10 lines_
- `-n <N>`: specify _N_ number of lines to display

## Tail

- shows last few lines of a text file
- default: _10 lines_
- `-n <N>`: specify _N_ number of lines to display
- more useful
- used to view log files

## More

- shows the entire file
- to go to next page -- `<spacebar>`
- to go to next line -- `<enter>`
- can also search
  - but only in downwards direction
- cannot go up or see previous lines

## Less

- _More powerful then `More`_
- can use arrow keys to scroll up/down
- pageup/pagedown works
- to search -- `/term<enter>`
  - will search for `term` in whole file
  - will search in both directions
  - will highlight all the matched items
- To exit press `<q>`
