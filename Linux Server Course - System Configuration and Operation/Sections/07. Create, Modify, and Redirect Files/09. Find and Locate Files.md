# Find and Locate Files

- These are used to find files on the hard drives

## `locate`

- `locate <string>`
- Will return full paths of all the files containing _string_ in the file name
- It uses a database to look for files
  - which is cached on the system
  - The cache is only updated once a day
  - To force an update `sudo updatedb`
- It is very fast as the searching is is based on cache and not done in real time

## `find`

- `find <path> -name <regex>`
- will return full paths of all files matching the _regex_ in the provided _path_
- more powerful
- slower as it searches in real time
- we can also pass more flags to do actions on the found files
  - `-delete` to delete the files
  - etc...
