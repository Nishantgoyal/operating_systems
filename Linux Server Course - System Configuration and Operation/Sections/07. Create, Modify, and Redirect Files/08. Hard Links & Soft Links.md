# Hard Links & Soft Links

- In a HardDrive every file takes up a certain number of blocks
  - These blocks are the actual data
- The FileSystem only knows where the blocks live via a _File Allocation Table_
  - It maps the files to the corresponding blocks

## _Soft (Symbolic) Link_

- does not point to the hard drive or any blocks
- instead it points to the file in the file allocation table
- if original file is deleted (or even renamed) the soft link is broken
- Syntax: `ln -s <source file> <soft link file>`
- The command `ls -l` actually shows us the symbolic link and the original file it is pointing to
- Generally used more
- Easy to see

## _Hard Link_

- it directly points to the exact same blocks on the hard drive
- it is an independent entity without any reference to the original file entry in the allocation table
- in case the original file (or the hard link) is deleted, the blocks can be referenced via the hard link (or the original file)
- we cannot tell which one is the hard link or the original file
- Syntax: `ln <source file> <hard link file>`
- The command `ls -lia` will show the _inode_ to which the files are pointing on the hard drive
  - Hard links will have a matching _inode_
- Also, the command `ls -l` will provide the count of hard links present on a particular inodes
- To find all the hard links to an inode
  - `find <path> -samefile <file_name>`
  - The `-samefile` flag will list all the files pointing to the same inode as of `file_name`
