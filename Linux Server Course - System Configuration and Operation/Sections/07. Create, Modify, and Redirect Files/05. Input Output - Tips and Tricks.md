# Input Output - Tips and Tricks

## `/dev/null`

- It is a location on the filesystem, in which if something is put, it will disappear forever
- used for extraneour logs, etc
- e.g.,
  - `echo hello > /dev/null`
    - will not print anything, as the content are redirected to `/dev/null`
  - `ls ff > /dev/null`
    - it will print the error, as the output channel is redirected, but not the error channel
  - `ls ff 2> /dev/null`
    - it will not print the error, as the error channel is redirected to `/dev/null`
  - `ls Documents ff 2>&1 > /dev/null`
    - it will not print anything, as both the output and error channels have been redirected to `/dev/null`

## _tee_

- It takes a standard input, and dumps the information into
  - its standard output
  - to a file

```shell
cat file.txt
# red
# yellow
# blue
# fish
cat file.txt | tee copy.txt
```

- it will print the contents of the _file.txt_ and also copy them to _copy.txt_

## xargs

- It takes the output from an app on its standard input
- then it dumps the contents of the input as arguments to another command
- Not all applications support input from stdin, so in such cases it becomes really powerful.

```shell
cat file.txt | xargs mkdir
```

- for each item in _file.txt_, `xargs` will put it as args to `mkdir` command
  - as a result, it will create a folder for each item in _file.txt_
