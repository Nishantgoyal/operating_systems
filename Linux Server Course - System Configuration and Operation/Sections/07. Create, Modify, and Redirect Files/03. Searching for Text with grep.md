# Searching for Text with grep

- grep stands for _GNU Regular Expression Parser_
- GREP uses Regular expressions for searching
- To ensure GREP is using raw string to search use the `-F` flag

```shell
grep -F search_string file
# With pipe directive
cat file | grep -F search_string
```

- The _pipe directive_ can be used with other commands who produce a string output
  - It also supports chaining

```shell
grep -F dhcp /var/log/syslog
dmesg | grep -F dhcp
dmesg | grep -F dhcp | grep -F init
```
