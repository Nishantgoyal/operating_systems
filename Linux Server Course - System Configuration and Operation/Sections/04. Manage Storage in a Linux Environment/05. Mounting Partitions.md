# Mounting Partitions

- We need to mount the partitions to be able to access data present on the partitions
- Mounting is basically addition of a path to the FileSystem
- It can be done manually using _mount/umount_ command, or
- It can be done at boot time using _/etc/fstab_ file
- When a drive is mounted
  - It becomes a folder
  - And the contents of the folder are what is stored on the drive
  - Needs to be mounted on an empty folder
- _blkid_ command provides info about the drives
  - UUID
  - TYPE
  - etc...
