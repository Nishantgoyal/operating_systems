    - Dual-Writes and Dual-Reads at the same time
  - Cons:
    - Single disk failure can cause data loss
- RAID1
  - Drives are setup in `Mirror`
  - All writes go to both the drives
  - Pros:
    - No data loss on single disk failure
  - Cons:
    - No performance gains
- RAID5
  - Uses a parity disk
  - Each write happens on any of the two disks
  - Pros:
    - Can handle single disk failure
  - Cons:
