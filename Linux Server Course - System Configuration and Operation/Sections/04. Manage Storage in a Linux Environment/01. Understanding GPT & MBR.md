# Understanding GPT & MBR

- These are two systems to partition and organise a hard drive
- GPT is much newer and feature rich

## MBR

- Stands for _Master Boot Record_
- Old technology
- MBR is the reserved space at the very beginning of the disk
- It describes how the disk is partitioned
- limited to terrabytes
- limited to 4 partitions
- used in BIOS system

## GPT

- Stands for _GUID Partition Table_
  - _GUID_ refers to _Globally Unique Identifier_
- New technology
- Technically does the same thing as an MBR
- Also it copies and scatters the _paritioning-info_ around the drive
  - for redundancy and reliability
  - for CRC and roubutness check
- very robust
- ability to use much bigger drive
- limited to Zettabytes (practically unlimited as of now)
- can have tons of partitions
- part of UEFI
- Has protective MBR
  - allows BIOS system to not consider the disk as empty
  - also provides info to some BIOS systems about the disk
    - provides backward compatibility
