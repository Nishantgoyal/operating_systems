# Scanning FileSystems

- `fsck` is used to scan the filesystems
  - Needs the filesystem to be unmounted to scan
- usually for root drive, need to be done at boot
- To setup automatic scanning of a drive
  - change the _pass_ parameter in _/etc/fstab_ file
  - The value of the _pass_ parameter should be
    - _1_ for root volume
    - _2_ for any other volume
    - _0_ to not scan drive on boot
  - Also, the _max mounts_ parameter need to be a positive value
    - default _-1_ to not allow file system check
    - can be viewed and modified using _tune2fs_ utility
    - if _max mounts_ is less then number of times the drive is mounted
      - system will not do file system check on the drive
