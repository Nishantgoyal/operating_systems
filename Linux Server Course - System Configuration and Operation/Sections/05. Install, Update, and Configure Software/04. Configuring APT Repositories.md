# Configuring APT Repositories

- Repositories are different groups of software packages
- For things not in standard debian system
  - but in 3rd party system
  - one can add a repository pointing to the 3rd party system
  - then apt-system can use it as any other package
- The configuration files for repositories are present in `/etc/apt` directory
- The `sources.list`
  - default repository configuration file
  - Each line is a repository configuration
  - Format:
    - `<package kind> <location URL> <folder> <version>`
  - All repositories need to be signed
  - To verify the repository owner, add the _gpg_ key of the repository
- The `sources.list.d` folder
  - New repo file `abc.list` can be created here
  - will be read just like the default repo file
- _ppa_ method
  - alternative way of installing repositories
  - _personal package archive_
  - To add a package: `add-apt-repository pps://<user>/repo_name`
    - will add the repo to sources.list.d folder
    - also download the key and sign the package
