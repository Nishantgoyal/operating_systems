# Managing deb files

- _deb_ files are how the programs are packages up in debian or ubuntu distributions
- To install a _deb_ package there are following ways:
  - _dpkg_
    - It is lowest level of interaction with the deb file
    - This is used behind the scenes by all packages
    - It does not do dependency resolution and pretty basic
  - _apt-get_
    - oldest
    - still works
  - _aptitude_
    - older
    - still works
  - _apt_
    - newer
    - simpler
    - recommended
    - looks for the latest version of the package
    - also finds all the dependencies and installs them
    - also easy to keep the packages updated
