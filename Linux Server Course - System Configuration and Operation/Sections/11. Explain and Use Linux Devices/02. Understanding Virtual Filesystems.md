# Understanding Virtual Filesystems

- A _Virtual Filesystem_ is created when the system boots up
- There are multiple filesystems
  - `/proc`
    - Used for process information
      - runtime information of the running apps
    - also contains info about other things
      - _CPU_
      - _Network Cards_
      - etc...
  - `/sys`
    - stores information about the system and kernel
    - it was developed to organise the system information present in _/proc_ folder
  - `/dev`
    - stores information about different devices
