# Understanding Network Server Roles

- Servers _serve_ things like
  - _ntp_ -- Network Time Protocol
  - _ssh_ -- Secure Shell Server
  - _DNS_ -- Domain Name Service
  - ...
- There are two types of services
  - _Centralised_
    - running on one server for the entire network
    - e.g.,
      - _DHCP_
      - _DNS_
      - _Config Management_
  - _Individual_
    - running on all or most of the servers
    - e.g.,
      - _SSH_
      - _config client_
      - _Docker_
  - There is some overlap in services, like _NTP_
- there are multiple ways to deploy services on servers
  - each service can be deployed on a seperate machine
    - very expensive
    - old approach
  - each service on a single huge server
    - messy
    - prone to errors and conflics
    - single point of failure
  - virtualisation
    - install service on a virtual software on the server
    - powerful
    - isolation
  - docker
    - each service is containerised
