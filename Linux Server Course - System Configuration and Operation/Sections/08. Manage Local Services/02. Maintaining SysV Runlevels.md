# Maintaining SysV Runlevels

- older way
- used by linux systems to control their behaviour on boot
- The start behaviour is defined by various modes

| Mode | Debian/Ubuntu                     | CentOS/Suse          |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0    | Halt                              | Halt                 |
| 1    | Single User Mode                  | Single User Mode     |
| 2    | Full, MultiUser, GUI if installed | Multi User, No Net   |
| 3    | Nothing                           | Multi User, With Net |
| 4    | Nothing                           | Not Used             |
| 5    | Nothing                           | Multi User GUI       |
| 6    | Reboot                            | Reboot               |

- `runlevel` command will show us the current runlevel
- `telinit <runlevel>` will change the runlevel
- To change the default runlevel, in which the system will enter on boot
  - modify the file: _/etc/inittab_
  - DO NOT PUT THE DEFAULT RUNLEVEL to `0, 6`
