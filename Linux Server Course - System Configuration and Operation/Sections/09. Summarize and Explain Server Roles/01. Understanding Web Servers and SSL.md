# Understanding Web Servers and SSL

- The web servers provides web pages and application on the internet
- _SSL_ is used to secure the traffic through the web servers
- _SSL Process_
  - Client sends a message to the server
    - for initiating the SSL connection
  - The WebServer responds with its certificate
    - The certificate describes the identity of the web server
    - it is intended to prove that the web server is who it says it is
    - prevents _man-in-the-middle_ attack
  - The client contacts the _certificate authority_
    - The _CA_ is a centralized trusted place
    - it signs the certificates
  - After the verification, the client sends the encryption key to the web server
  - The server uses the key sent by the client to encrypt the data to be sent
- For servers in own networks, we can have _self-signed certificates_
  - Not authorized with certificate authority
  - usually fine on local networks
  - not fine on public networks
