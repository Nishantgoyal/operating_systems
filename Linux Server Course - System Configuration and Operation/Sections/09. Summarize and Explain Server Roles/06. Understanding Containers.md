# Understanding Containers

## Traditional Virtual Machines

- Inside the physical machines
  - A section of host resources is carved out
  - Another Operating System is installed inside the virtualised environment
  - Application are run on top of the operating systems

## Container

- Run directly inside the host operating system
- In a containerised application,
  - The applications are isolated in their own filesystem
  - They are _JAILED OFF_ from the rest of the system
- The application are still running directly on the operating system
