# Understanding Local Network Server Roles

- The local network servers usage has decreased recently
  - emergence of cloud is one of the reasons for it

## File Services

- There are many ways to setup file sharing locally, e.g.,
  - _Samba_ for Windows
  - _NFS_ for Linux, Windows, MAC
  - _Netatalk_ for Mac
- There are cloud services which provide sharing and storage of files
  - For e.g., _Dropbox_, _Google Drive_, _One Drive_, etc
  - These also provide robust backups as all hardware is handled by large companies

## Print Services

- We have _CUPS_ -- Common Unix Printing Service
  - It used to solve all requirements associated with printing
  - Printers themselves have logic to handle multiple print jobs and servers are not required
- Local printers can also be used through cloud services
  - It provides us _No Configuration Printing_
  - e.g., _GooglePrint_, _AirPrint_

## Mail

- For security reasons, we might prefer to do a local setup of a mail server
  - but keeping a local mail server can be a full time job
  - some services that provides local mail servers:
    - _postfix_
    - _Exim_
    - _sendmail_
- Cloud provided mail services are specially popular, since
  - the large companies take care of all the security and hardware related things
  - e.g., _gmail_, _yahoo_, _outlook_, etc...

## Proxy

- Mistakenly confued with _Web Filters_
- Primary job is to distribute incoming load to various servers
  - e.g., _squid_
- There are cloud hosted solutions to work as the proxy
  - e.g.,
    - _OpenDNS_
    - _Akamai_
