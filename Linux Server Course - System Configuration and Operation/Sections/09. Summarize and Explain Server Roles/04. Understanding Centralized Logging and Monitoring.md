# Understanding Centralized Logging and Monitoring

- These are mosly required for big networks
  - can also be helpful in smaller networks

## Centralized Logging

- Logs are generated by many devices
  - Servers
  - IOT
  - Databases, etc
- In centralized logging we redirect the logs to a central location
- The central log server will have one large file
  - each device will put its identification on the corresponding log lines
- Combining logs in this way, also exposes trends and relations between the events from the different log files

## SNMP

- Stands for _Simple Network Management Protocol_
- It is used for reading network data
  - e.g., interface statistics
- traditionally the protocol could also control remote devices
