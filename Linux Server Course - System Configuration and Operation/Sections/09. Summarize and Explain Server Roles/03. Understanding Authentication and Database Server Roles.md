# Understanding Authentication and Database Server Roles

- These are two server roles, which are often setup on local network
  - They are required to be run on robust servers
- Traditional database applications are mostly based on SQL
  - e.g., _MySQL_, _MariaDB_, etc...
- There are also many NoSQL services
- For authentication services, we need a central place to authenticate our users
  - it should also be very robust, highly available and secure
  - e.g., _Active Directory_, _OpenLDAP_, _NIS_, etc...
