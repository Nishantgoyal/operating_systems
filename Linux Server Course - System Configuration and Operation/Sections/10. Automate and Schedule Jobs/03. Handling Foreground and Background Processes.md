# Handling Foreground and Background Processes

- To put a process in the _background_, put an `&` (_ampersand_) in the end
  - Syntax: `<command> <args> &`
  - it will return the process id and the prompt for further commands
  - Each job running in background also receives an ID
- To view the jobs running in background, run `jobs` command
- To bring a background job into foreground, run `fg <job id>`
- To move a running job to background
  - press `<ctrl> z`
    - this will put the job into background in _stopped_ state
  - then execute `bg <job id>` to start the job in the background
- The background process started in this way _DO NOT PERSIST ACROSS SESSIONS_
- To ensure a process is not killed on logout, run it with `nohup` command
- Syntax: `nohup <command> <args> &`
