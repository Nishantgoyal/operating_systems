# User and Group Quotas

- It is a way of ensuring users and groups do not overuse the hard drive
- There are two types of quota limits
  - _soft_ limits
    - If this is reached, the user is warned everyday
  - _hard_ limits
    - On reaching this limit, one is no longer able to save file on the drive
- To use quotas:
  1. Ensure the partition is mounted correctly
     - The option _usrquota_ (_grpquota_ for group quota) is enabled on the drive
  2. Scan the particular drive to find out files owned by a particular user
     - `sudo quotacheck -au`
       - _-a_: scan all disks/partitions that support quota
       - _-u_: for user only files
  3. Turn quotas on
     - `sudo quotaon -a`
  4. To set a particular quota for a user
     - `sudo edquota <username>`
     - Opens a editable file with a table
     - Each row is a disk/partition that support quotas
     - There are two kinds of limits we can set:
       - a limit for _inodes_
         - limits the number of files a user can store
       - a limit for _blocks_
         - limits the number of (1KB) blocks
