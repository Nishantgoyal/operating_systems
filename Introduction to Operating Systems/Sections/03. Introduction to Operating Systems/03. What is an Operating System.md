# What is an Operating System?

- A computing systems consist of a number of hardware components
  - one or more processing element, CPUs
    - CPUs can also contain multiple cores
  - Memory
  - Network interconnect devices like Ethernet port, WiFi card
  - Graphics Processing cards
  - Storage devices
    - Hard disks
    - SSDs
    - Flash devices like USB drives
- All of the hardware components will be used by multiple applications
  - except for some specific cases, like sensors, embedded systems
- An Operating System is
  - the layer of systems software
  - that sits between
    - the complex hardware
    - applications

## Abstraction

- from applications and application developers
  - e.g., no need to target free blocks to save application output on disk

### Storage Devices

- Hides complexities of various types of storage devices
- E.g.,
  - Hard disks
  - SSDs
  - USB Flash
- It manages a higher level abstraction of `file`
- It provides number of operations
  - Reads/Writes
  - can be performed on `file`

### Networking

- Abstracts the networking resources
  - No need to think about
    - the bits flowing through the network
    - packets that are to be composed for the communication
- The higher level abstraction is called `socket`
- provides some services to send/receive data to/from the socket

## Resource Management

- Operating System manages the hardware
  - on behalf of the executing applications
- E.g.,
  - Memory Allocation for the applications
  - CPU Scheduling
  - Access control for various devices on the system

## Isolation and Protection

- Operating System ensures that multiple applications
  - can make adequate progress
  - don't impact or hurt each other
- E.g.,
  - It allocates different part of the memory to different applications
  - also ensures applications do not access each other's memory
