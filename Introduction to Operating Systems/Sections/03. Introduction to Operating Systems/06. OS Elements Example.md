# OS Elements Example

## Memory Management

- Operating System uses memory page as an abstraction
- A memory page corresponds to
  - some addressable region of memory
  - with fixed size - say 4K
- OS also have mechanisms to operate on that page
  - allocating that page in DRAM
  - map the page into the address piece of the process
  - allows the app to access the actual physical memory through the page
  - the page may be relocated to
    - different physical locations in the memory
    - stored on disk
- OS use policies to decide whether the page will be stored in physical memory or disk
- The process of moving pages back and forth from disk to memory is called `swapping`
