# OS Protection Boundary

- Computer platforms distinguish between at-least **_two modes_** of operations
  - _kernel mode_
    - privileged
    - direct access to hardware resources
    - os operates here
  - _user mode_
    - unprivileged
    - user application run here

## User Kernel Switch

- Distinguishes between the two modes
- in CPU a special bit is present
  - if it is set,
    - it means kernel mode
    - privileged mode instructions can be executed on the hardware
  - if it is not set
    - it means user mode
    - privileged instruction will be forbidden
- Instructions in user-mode that tries to execute such instructions
  - will be forbidden
  - cause a trap
  - the application will be interrupted
  - hardware will switch the control to the operating system at a specific location
  - the os will check the cause of the trap, and verify
    - if it needs to grant the access to the app
    - terminate the process if trying to do something illegal

## System Call Interfaces

- Used for interaction between the application and the operating system
- It is exported by the operating system
- It is a set of instructions
  - that the application can invoke
  - to perform
    - certain service
    - certain privilege access
  - on behalf of application
- E.g.
  - `open(file)`
  - `send(socket)`
  - `malloc(memory)`

## Signals

- mechanism for operating system to pass notification to the applications
