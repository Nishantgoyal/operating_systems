# Crossing the OS Boundary

## User/Kernel Transitions

- A necessary step during application execution
  - for accessing certain types of hardware
  - for changing hardware resources allocated to them
- The hardware provides support for it
- As application tries to perform some privileged instruction
  - results in a trap
- the trap causes transfer of control to os kernel
  - marks the special privilege bit
- the os kernel checks
  - what caused the trap
  - what to do next
    - grant the application request that caused the trap
    - deny the same

### Issues

- Even with hardware support
  - still takes a number of operations
  - NOT CHEAP!!
- Switches Locality
  - affects hardware cache
  - replaces application data present in hardware cache
- Application performance varies depending on whether the cache is
  - hot
    - the application is accessing cache with data present in it
  - cold
    - the application accesses cache which does not contain the required data
