# OS Services

- An Operating system provides
  - access to the underlying hardware
  - via exporting a number of services
- Basic level services
  - directly linked to some components of the hardware
  - _Scheduler_
    - Responsible for controlling the access
      - to the CPU
      - or multuple CPUs
  - _Memory Manager_
    - allocating underlying physical memory
      - to one-or-more co-running application
    - ensuring multiple applications
      - don't overwrite each other's access to the memory
  - _Block Driver_
    - responsible for access to a block device like disk
- Also there are higher level services
  - linked with higher level abstractions
  - _File_/_File System_
- An Operating System incorporates
  - a number of services
  - to provide applications and application developers
  - with a number of useful types of functionality
    - `_Process Management_`
    - `_File Management_`
    - `_Device Management_`
    - `_Memory Management_`
    - `_Storage Management_`
    - `_Security_`
    - ...
- Operating System makes the services available via _System Calls_
