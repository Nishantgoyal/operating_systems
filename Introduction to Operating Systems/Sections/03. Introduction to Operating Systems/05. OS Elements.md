# OS Elements

## Operating System Abstractions

- abstracting applications executed on operating system
  - process
  - thread
  - ...
- hardware resources os manages
  - file - abstracts storage devices
  - socket - abstracts network devices
  - memory page - abstracts actual memory
  - ...
- ...

## Operating System Mechanisms

- These operate on top of the abstractions
- E.g.
  - create/launch an application
  - schedule an application on run on the CPU
  - open/gain access to a particular device
  - write/update state of a resource
  - allocate a particular type of resource to an application

## Operating System Policies

- These policies are integrated to determine exactly how the mechanisms are used to manage the underlying hardware
- E.g.,
  - A policy might control the max number of `sockets` for a `process`
  - control which page will be freed on memory on exhaustion
    - based on some algorithm like,
      - least recently used (LRU)
      - earliest deadline first (EDF)
