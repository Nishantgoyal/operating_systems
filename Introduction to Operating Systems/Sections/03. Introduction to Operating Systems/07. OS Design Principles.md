# OS Design Principles

## Seperation between mechanism and policy

- implement flexible mechanisms to support many policies
  - LRU
    - keep track of when page was last used
    - discard pages that are least recently used
  - LFU
    - keep track of how frequently a page is ued over a period of time
    - discard page that is least frequently used
  - random
- Will need to implement some mechanism to track
  - the frequency or the time
  - when memory locations have been accessed
- While selecting policy for the mechanism, one needs to
  - optimise for the common case
- To decide the policy, understand the following considerations
  - where will the OS be used?
  - what will be executed by the user on the machine?
  - what will be the workload requirements?
