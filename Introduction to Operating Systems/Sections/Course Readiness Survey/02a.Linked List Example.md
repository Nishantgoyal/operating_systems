# Linked List Example

- [C Linked List Data Structure Explained with an Example C Program](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/08/c-linked-list-example/)

- Linked list is
  - One of the fundamental data structures in C
  - A dynamic data structure
  - Length can be increased or decreased at run time
- Difference from array
  - _Array_
    - A static data structure
    - Length of array cannot be altered at run time
    - All the elements are kept at consecutive memory locations
  - _linked list_
    - A dynamic data structure
    - Length can be increased or decreased at run time
    - The elements (or nodes) may be kept at any location but still connected to each other
- Linked lists are preferred
  - when you don’t know the volume of data to be stored

## How linked lists are arranged in memory?

- Linked list consists of
  - memory blocks
  - located at random memory locations
  - connected through pointers
- A block in a linked list is represented through a structure like this

  ```c
  struct test_struct
  {
    int val;
    struct test_struct *next;
  };
  ```

- Structure contains
  - a value `val`
    - any value (depending upon the data that the linked list is holding)
  - a pointer to a structure of same type
    - contains the address of next block of this linked list
    - The `next` pointer of the last node (or for a single node linked list) would contain a NULL
- Linked list traversal is made possible through the `next` pointers

## How a node is created?

- Created by allocating memory to the structure

```c
struct test_struct *ptr = (struct test_struct*)malloc(sizeof(struct test_struct));
```

- the pointer `ptr` contains address of a newly created node
- The first node of a linked list is also known as head node
- Once a node is created
  - it can be assigned the value
  - its next pointer is assigned the address of next node
- If no next node exists a NULL is assigned

## How to search a node in a linked list?

- linear search
- Start with the first node
  - then compare the value which is being searched with the value contained in this node
  - If the value does not match
    - then through the ‘next’ pointer the next node is accessed
    - same value comparison is done there
- Search goes on until
  - either last node is accessed
  - or node is found whose value is equal to the value being searched

```c
// ...
while(ptr != NULL) {
  if(ptr->val == val) {
    found = true;
    break;
  } else {
    ptr = ptr->next;
  }
}
// ...
```

## How a node is deleted?

- First finding it in the linked list
  - then calling free() on the pointer containing its address
- If the deleted node is any node other than the first and last node then
  - the ‘next’ pointer of the previous node to the deleted node
    - needs to be pointed to
      - the address of the node that is just after the deleted node
