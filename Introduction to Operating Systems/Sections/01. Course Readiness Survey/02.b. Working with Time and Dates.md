# Working with Time and Dates

- [Working with Time and Dates](https://www.codingunit.com/c-tutorial-how-to-use-time-and-date-in-c)
- To make use of time and date function
  - include the `time.h` header file
  - from the standard C library
- The header file contains functions and macros
  - provide standardized access to time and date.
  - manipulate and format the time and date output

## UNIX Time or POSIX Time

- The function `time()`
  - returns the type `time_t`
  - represents the number of seconds elapsed since `00:00 hours, Jan 1, 1970 UTC`
  - It’s also called **_UNIX EPOCH_** time

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
int main ()
{
    time_t sec;
    sec = time (NULL);

    printf ("Number of hours since January 1, 1970 is %ld \n", sec/3600);
    return 0;
}
```

## Readable Current Local Time using ctime

- The Unix EPOCH time is not readable for humans
- Get a human-readable version of the current local time use the ctime() function
- It returns a C string
  - containing the date and time information
  - followed by a new-line character (‘\n’)
- converts the time_t object pointed by the timer to a C string
  - containing a human-readable version of the corresponding local time and date
- The string that is returned will have the following format:
  - `Www Mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy`
    - **_Www_** ==> which day of the week.
    - **_Mmm_** ==> month in letters.
    - **_dd_** ==> the day of the month.
    - hh:mm:**_ss_** ==> the time in hour, minutes, seconds.
    - **_yyyy_** ==> the year.
- E.g --> `Tue Feb 26 09:01:47 2009`

## Manipulating the time structure with mktime()

```cpp
#include <time.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  struct tm str_time;
  time_t time_of_day;

  str_time.tm_year = 2012-1900;
  str_time.tm_mon = 6;
  str_time.tm_mday = 5;
  str_time.tm_hour = 10;
  str_time.tm_min = 3;
  str_time.tm_sec = 5;
  str_time.tm_isdst = 0;

  time_of_day = mktime(&str_time);
  printf("%s", ctime(&time_of_day));

  return 0;
}
```
