# Process Control Block

- It is a data structure OS manages
- It is present of each of the processes
- The Process Control Block is created when the process is created
  - also initialised
- Certain fields of the PCB changes
  - when the process state changes
  - e.g., while requesting more memory
  - does not happen too often
- Other fields might change very frequently
  - e.g., _Program Counter_ changes on every single instruction
  - To handle this, CPU has a dedicated register
  - The register keeps track of the currently executing instruction
  - The OS is responsible for collecting information from the PC register
    - and updating the PCB, when the process is not running on the CPU

## Components of a Process Control Block

- process state
- process number
- program counter
- registers
- memory limits
- list of open files
- priority
- signal mask
- CPU Scheduling info
