# Process Execution State

- Applications are compiled into Assembly code
  - A sequence of instructions in assembly language
  - Not necessarily executed sequentially cause of
    - jumps
    - loops
    - interrupts
    - etc
- _Program Counter_
  - The CPU needs to know
    - which instruction is currently getting executed
  - This is done using the Program Counter
  - It contains the address of the currently executing instruction
  - Stored in CPU Register
- _CPU Registers_
  - These are located inside the CPU
  - It is the fastest form of memory
    - provides data at almost clock speed
  - It holds value necessary for process execution
    - some addresses
    - status info about the process
    - etc
- _Stack Pointer_
  - Process Stack defines what the process is currently doing
  - Stack Pointer keeps track of the top of the stack
- There are other pieces of information also required to define a process state
- To maintain this information for each process
  - the OS maintains a structure called **_`The Process Control Block`_**
