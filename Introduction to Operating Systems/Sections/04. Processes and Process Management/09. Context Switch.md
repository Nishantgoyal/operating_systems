# Context Switch

- It is a mechanism used by the operating system
  - to switch the CPU from the context of one process
  - to the context of the other process
- It is an expensive operation
  - _direct costs_
    - number of cycles for load and store operations
    - to and from the PCB and CPU registers
  - _indirect costs_
    - When a process is running
      - a lot of its data is stored on the processor cache
        - L1 Cache
        - L2 Cache
        - etc...
      - accessing the cache is much fater then memory
        - 100-200x faster
      - When the data required by the process is present in the cache
        - it is called as HOT cache
      - On context switch, the data in cache is
        - replaced to make room for new process' data
      - When P1 resumes later
        - the cache will likely not contain the data required by P1
        - such a cache is called COLD cache
        - Process will spend a lot of time fetching data from main memory
          - incurring cache misses
      - COLD cache
        - increases the latency of data accesses
        - slows down the execution of the process
  - **_LIMIT HOW FREQUENTLY CONTEXT SWITCHING IS DONE_**
