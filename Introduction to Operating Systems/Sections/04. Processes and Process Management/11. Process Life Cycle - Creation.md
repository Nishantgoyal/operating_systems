# Process Life Cycle: Creation

![Process Life Cycle - Creation](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud923/notes/ud923-p2l1-process-tree.png)

- In Operating Systems,
  - _a process can create child processes_
  - All processes come from a single root
  - All processes have some relationship to one another
  - The creating process is the parent process
  - The created process is the child process
- _Root Processes_
  - Some of the processes are privileged
  - These are called as root processes
  - First the initial boot process is done
  - Then the operating system is loaded
  - Then the operating system creates some number of initial processes
- When user logs in
  - a user shell process is created
  - When user types in commands,
    - like `ls`, `vim`, etc
    - new corresponding processes get spawned from the shell parent process

## Mechanisms for Process Creation

A process can create child via either of the two mechanisms

- _fork_
  - create a new Process Control Block for the child process
  - copies the values from the parent PCB into the child PCB
    - including the program counter and registers, etc
  - both parent and the child continues execution at instruction after fork
- _exec_
  - create a new Process Control Block for the child process
  - the values inside the child PCB _do not match_ with the parent process
  - The operating system places the child's image
    - loads a new program
  - The program counter of the child process will
    - point to the first instruction of the new program
