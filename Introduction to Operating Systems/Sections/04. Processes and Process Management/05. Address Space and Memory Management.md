# Address Space and Memory Management

- Memory Address Considerations
  - Not all process require the complete address space
  - Multiple processes running simaltaneously
  - Limited memory
- Operating System decides dynamically
  - which portion of which address space
  - to be allocated where in memory
- Also, some portions of a process address space might be
  - swapped temporarily to disk (according to some policy)
  - will be brought to memory as and when required
- OS also maintains information about where the virtual addresses are mapped to
  - physical addresses in memory
  - swapped to disk
