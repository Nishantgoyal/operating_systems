# Role of the CPU Scheduler

- A process must be ready before execution
- There will be multiple process in the ready queue
  - waiting to be executed on the CPU
- which process should be given the CPU next?

## CPU Scheduler

- It is an Operating System Component
- It manages how processes use the CPU resources
- Decides
  - which one of the currently ready processes
    - will be dispatched to the CPU
  - how long the process will be allowed to run on the CPU
    - before being moved to the ready queue

## Scheduling Algorithm

- To schedule a new process OS must
  - _preempt_
    - the currently running process
    - interrupt the process
    - save its context to the PCB
  - _schedule_
    - run the scheduler to choose the next process
  - _dispatch_
    - dispatch the process from the ready queue
    - switch the CPU into its context
- The above flow must be very efficient
  - so that the CPU time is spent running processes
  - rathen then scheduling and other OS operations
