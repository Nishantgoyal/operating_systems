# Process Address Space

- The process representation in memory is referred to as an address space
  - `V0` to Vmax` represents
    - the max size of the address space
    - These addresses are called -- **_Virtual Addresses_**
- Virtual addresses do not have to correspond to the physical addresses in the memory
- The memory management system have page tables
- Page Tables consist of mapping
  - from virtual addresses
  - to physical addresses
- Each mapping inside a page table is called a _page table entry_
- E.g.,
  - For a Variable `x`
  - Virtual Address: 0x03c5
  - Physical Address: 0xf0f0
  - Page Table Entry:

| V_add  | P_add  |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0x03c5 | 0xf0f0 |

- The process is not notified (or concerned) with the physical addresses
- The OS takes care of the mapping
- Any access to `x` will access the correct location of the variable `x` in the physical address
