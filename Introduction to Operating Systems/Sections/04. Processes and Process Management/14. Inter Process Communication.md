# Inter Process Communication

- The IPC mechanisms must
  - transfer data/info between address spaces
  - maintain protection and isolation
  - provide flexibility and performance

## Messaging Passing IPC

- OS establishes a communication channel between the processes
  - like shared buffer
- The processes interect with it
  - write (send)
  - read (receive)
  - messages to/from the channel
- Every process has to
  - explicitly create a message
  - send the message to the dedicated channel
- Benefit of the approach is that
  - it is managed by operating system
  - standard APIs
  - exact same system calls for interacting with the communications channel
- The approach has some overheads cause of the OS involvememt

## Shared Memory IPC

- OS establishes the shared memory channel
  - maps it to each process' address space
- Processes can read/write ti the shared memory
  - like any other virtual memory address that are part of it
- The advantage is performance, as OS is not involved in the communication
- The disadvantage is
  - error prone
  - No well defined API
  - require implementation of code to provide reliability
